		<h1> About The Game </h1>
		
		<p class="TextFix"> World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the fourth released game set in the fantasy Warcraft universe, which was first introduced by Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994.[3] World of Warcraft takes place within the Warcraft world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous Warcraft release, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.[4] Blizzard Entertainment announced World of Warcraft on September 2, 2001.[5] The game was released on November 23, 2004, on the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise.

		The first expansion set of the game, The Burning Crusade, was released on January 16, 2007.[6] 
		The second expansion set, Wrath of the Lich King, was released on November 13, 2008.[7] 
		The third expansion set, Cataclysm, was released on December 7, 2010. The fourth expansion set, 
		Mists of Pandaria, was released on September 25, 2012.[8] The fifth expansion set, Warlords of Draenor, was released on November 13, 2014.
		The sixth expansion set, Legion, was announced at Gamescom 2015, on August 6, 2015 and is scheduled to be released on August 30, 2016.[10]

		With 5.5 million subscribers as of the beginning of November 2015,[11] 
		World of Warcraft is currently the world's most-subscribed MMORPG,[7][12] and holds the Guinness World Record for the most popular MMORPG by subscribers.
		Having grossed over 10 billion dollars as of July 2012, it is also the highest grossing video game of all time.
		In January 2014, it was announced that more than 100 million accounts had been created over the game's lifetime.</p>
		
		<h2> Development </h2>
		<p class="TextFix">World of Warcraft was first announced by Blizzard at the ECTS trade show in September 2001.[51] 
		Released in 2004, development of the game took roughly 4â€“5 years, including extensive testing. 
		The 3D graphics in World of Warcraft use elements of the proprietary graphics engine originally used in Warcraft III.[51] 
		The game was designed to be an open environment where players are allowed to do what they please.[52] Quests are optional and were designed to help guide players, 
		allow character development, and to spread characters across different zones to try to avoid what developers called player collision.[53] The game interface allows players to 
		customize appearance and controls, and to install add-ons and other modifications.[54]

		World of Warcraft runs natively on both Macintosh and Windows platforms. 
		Boxed copies of the game use a hybrid CD to install the game, eliminating the need for separate Mac and Windows retail products. 
		The game allows all users to play together, regardless of their operating system. Although there is no official version for any 
		other platform, support for World of Warcraft is present in Windows API implementations Wine and CrossOver allowing the game to 
		be played under Linux and FreeBSD.[55] In addition, the Windows client allows for direct OpenGL rendering in Wine, making performance on 
		Unix-like platforms comparable to the native performance seen on Windows.[56] While a native Linux client is neither released nor announced 
		by Blizzard, in January 2011 IT journalist Michael Larabel indicated in a Phoronix article that an internal Linux client might exist but is not 
		released due to the non-standardization of the linux distro ecosystem. </p>
